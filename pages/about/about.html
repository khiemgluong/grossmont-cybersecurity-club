    <h4 style="text-align: center">Grossmont Computer Science and Cybersecurity Club is a student-led organization focused on providing a community for students in the<br>
        Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District who are interested in cybersecurity. Our club aims to offer
        opportunities for members<br> to gain practical skills, attend industry events, and build relationships with like-minded
        individuals. We launched this archival website<br> to keep track of our activities for the benefit of current and future
        members, with the goal of building a lasting legacy for the club.
