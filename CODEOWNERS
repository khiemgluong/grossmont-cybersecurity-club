# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner #This is an inline comment.

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
*.txt @octo-org/octocats

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @khiemgluong

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @khiemgluong

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/docs/ @khiemgluong

# In this example, any change inside the `root` directory
# will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
/ @doctocat @octocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in a `/logs` directory such as
# `/build/logs`, `/scripts/logs`, and `/deeply/nested/logs`. Any changes
# in a `/logs` directory will require approval from @octocat.

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
